Relying Party integration
=========================

A Relying Party (RP) sends the user to an OpenID Provider (OP), receives an
authorization code on its callback, exchanges it for tokens, verifies the
id_token, and optionally fetches userinfo. :mod:`pygrindvakt.rp` implements
each step; this guide strings them together. The runnable version is
``examples/flask-rp`` in the repository.

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1

Discovery
---------

Resolve the OP's metadata from its issuer URL. The issuer must be ``https``
(plain ``http`` only for loopback hosts), and the ``issuer`` in the returned
document must equal the requested one exactly, so a document served from the
wrong place cannot redirect you to someone else's endpoints.

.. code-block:: python

   from pygrindvakt import http, rp

   http_client = http.ReqwestClient()                     # never follows redirects, bounded body
   md = rp.discover(http_client, "https://op.example.com")
   info = rp.ProviderInfo.from_metadata(md)

Discovery is one HTTP round trip; keep ``info`` for the process lifetime and
refresh it on a timer. The provider's signing keys are cached by a
:class:`~pygrindvakt.rp.JwksCache` (see below). For a statically configured OP, build the
:class:`~pygrindvakt.rp.ProviderInfo` by hand instead:

.. code-block:: python

   info = rp.ProviderInfo(
       "https://op.example.com",
       "https://op.example.com/authorization",
       "https://op.example.com/token",
       userinfo_endpoint="https://op.example.com/userinfo",
       jwks_uri="https://op.example.com/jwks",
   )

The client
----------

An :class:`~pygrindvakt.rp.RpClient` carries the ``client_id``, the
``redirect_uri`` registered at the OP, the requested ``scope`` and how the
client authenticates at the token endpoint. The method defaults to
``client_secret_basic`` when a secret is given and ``none`` otherwise;
inconsistent combinations raise :class:`~pygrindvakt.ConfigError` (also a
``ValueError``) rather than being ignored.

.. code-block:: python

   me = rp.RpClient("demo", "https://rp.example.com/cb", client_secret=os.environ["OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET"])
   # or, for a public client (native app, SPA): rp.RpClient("spa", "https://rp.example.com/cb")

Starting the flow: PKCE, state and nonce in the session
-------------------------------------------------------

:func:`~pygrindvakt.rp.begin` generates three fresh random values per login
and builds the authorization URL; store the values in the user's session
before redirecting:

* ``state`` binds the callback to this browser session (CSRF protection on
  the callback).
* ``nonce`` binds the id_token to this authorization request (replay
  protection); it comes back inside the signed id_token.
* the PKCE ``verifier`` binds the code exchange to the party that started
  the flow; only its ``S256`` challenge leaves the RP.

.. code-block:: python

   @app.get("/login")
   def login():
       url, state, nonce, verifier = rp.begin(info, me)
       session["oidc"] = {"state": state, "nonce": nonce, "verifier": verifier}
       return redirect(url)

``state`` and ``nonce`` are 32 random bytes each and the verifier is 48
(64 characters, within the RFC 7636 range). ``pkce=False`` is refused for
public clients.

Under the hood this is :func:`~pygrindvakt.rp.authorization_url` plus
:func:`pygrindvakt.util.random_token` and
:func:`pygrindvakt.pkce.s256_challenge`; call those directly if you need
full control.

Per-request redirect URI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   Never take ``redirect_uri`` from request parameters (query string, form
   fields, headers such as ``Host`` or ``X-Forwarded-*``). An attacker-chosen
   value would send the authorization code to their site. The exact-match
   rule against ``redirect_uris`` exists for that reason: choose from your
   own registered list, never pass request data through.

``begin``, ``authorization_url`` and ``signed_request_object`` accept a
keyword-only ``redirect_uri`` that replaces the client's configured one for
that call. It must exactly equal the client's ``redirect_uri`` or one of
``RpClient(redirect_uris=[...])``, a fixed server-side list that you also
register at the OP (:class:`pygrindvakt.BadRequestError` otherwise). Entries
must be absolute, have no fragment and not be plain ``http`` to a non-loopback
host (``https``, loopback ``http`` and custom schemes for native apps are
fine). "Loopback" means exactly ``localhost``, ``127.0.0.0/8`` or ``::1``
(not ``foo.localhost`` or ``localhost.``). The client's own configured
``redirect_uri`` is not transport-checked (unchanged), so use ``https`` there
too. In the example, ``cb`` is one of those registered strings (for
instance chosen by which of your own hosts served the login page).
Pass the **same value** to ``exchange_code(..., redirect_uri=...)`` (RFC 6749
section 4.1.3), so keep it in the session with the other values:

.. code-block:: python

   url, state, nonce, verifier = rp.begin(info, me, redirect_uri=cb)
   session["oidc"] = {"state": state, "nonce": nonce, "verifier": verifier, "redirect_uri": cb}
   # callback:
   ts = rp.exchange_code(http_client, info, me, code,
                         code_verifier=pending["verifier"], redirect_uri=pending["redirect_uri"])

Register the alternatives on the client::

   me = rp.RpClient("demo", "https://rp.example.com/cb",
                    redirect_uris=["https://rp.example.com/alt"])

``RpClient(allow_unregistered_redirect_uri=True)`` disables the registration
check, for RPs that register redirect URIs dynamically (RFC 7591). The
override must still be a valid URL and not plain ``http`` to a non-loopback
host, but any attacker-influenced value is now accepted, so the warning above
applies with full force.

``authorization_url`` also accepts ``extra`` parameters (a dict or a list of
pairs, so names can repeat) for ``prompt``, ``acr_values``, ``login_hint`` or
a signed request object:

.. code-block:: python

   url = rp.authorization_url(info, me, state, nonce, code_challenge=challenge,
                              extra={"prompt": "login", "acr_values": "urn:mfa"})

The callback: exchange and verify
---------------------------------

On the callback, parse the response with
:func:`~pygrindvakt.rp.parse_authorization_response`, then check ``state``
against the session entry (popped so it can be used only once) with
:meth:`~pygrindvakt.rp.AuthorizationResponse.matches_state` and ``iss``
with :meth:`~pygrindvakt.rp.AuthorizationResponse.matches_iss`. Then exchange the code with the stored verifier and verify the
id_token against the issuer, your ``client_id`` and the stored nonce, using the
process-wide :class:`~pygrindvakt.rp.JwksCache`.

.. code-block:: python

   from pygrindvakt import AuthnError, BadRequestError, ConfigError, GrindvaktError

   # Created once at startup, next to `info`; thread-safe, shared by all requests.
   jwks_cache = rp.JwksCache(http_client, info.jwks_uri, info.issuer)

   @app.get("/callback")
   def callback():
       pending = session.pop("oidc", None)
       try:
           # items(multi=True) keeps duplicates; a plain dict would hide them.
           resp = rp.parse_authorization_response(list(request.args.items(multi=True)))
       except BadRequestError as e:
           log.warning("bad callback: %s", e.log_summary)
           abort(400)
       # The parse proves nothing: state and iss are still ours to check.
       if pending is None or not resp.matches_state(pending["state"]):
           abort(400)                                        # not our flow
       if not resp.matches_iss(info.issuer):
           abort(400)                                        # wrong OP or missing iss (RFC 9207)
       if resp.is_error:
           log.warning("OP returned %s: %s", resp.error, resp.error_description_safe)
           return render_template("login_failed.html")
       try:
           ts = rp.exchange_code(http_client, info, me, resp.code, code_verifier=pending["verifier"])
           claims = rp.verify_id_token(
               jwks_cache, ts.id_token, info.issuer, me.client_id,
               pending["nonce"], ["ES256"],
           )
       except ConfigError as e:
           log.error("RP misconfigured: %s", e.log_summary)  # deployment fault: log, alert, 500
           raise
       except GrindvaktError as e:
           log.warning("login failed: %s", e.log_summary)    # log_summary is for logs only
           if e.retryable:                                   # OP or network trouble
               return render_template("login_unavailable.html"), 503
           return render_template("login_failed.html"), 401 if e.auth_failure else 400
       session["user"] = {"sub": claims["sub"], "email": claims.get("email")}
       return redirect("/")

:func:`~pygrindvakt.rp.parse_authorization_response` replaces hand-written
``request.args`` handling. It refuses repeated parameters, a response with
both or neither of ``code`` and ``error``, control, bidi or invisible
characters and values over 2048 characters in ``code`` / ``state`` / ``iss``,
a malformed ``error`` and a JARM ``response`` (see
`ADR 0007 <https://github.com/kushaldas/pygrindvakt/blob/main/docs/adr/0007-authorization-response-parsing.md>`_).
It proves nothing by itself: you still call ``matches_state`` (constant
time) and ``matches_iss``, always before exchanging the code. Both fail
closed. ``matches_state`` keeps ``required=True`` because ``rp.authorization_url``
and ``rp.begin`` always send ``state`` (RFC 6749 section 10.12); pass
``required=False`` only for a request you deliberately built without it. A
response without ``iss`` does not match. Only if the OP metadata does **not** advertise
``authorization_response_iss_parameter_supported`` (RFC 9207 section 2.4) may you
pass ``required=False`` so that a missing ``iss`` is tolerated; a present
``iss`` is always compared exactly. Log
``error_description_safe``, never the raw ``error_description`` (the binding
does not expose it: it is provider-controlled text). Treat ``error_uri`` as
untrusted: do not follow it or render it as a link (it is kept only as an
https URL, or plain http for loopback). Unknown error codes are
kept (``error_known`` is false) so they can be logged and shown as a generic
failure. ``error_known`` is wider than what
:class:`~pygrindvakt.OAuthError` accepts, so do not rebuild an ``OAuthError``
from ``resp.error``: ``OAuthError("consent_required")`` raises
``ValueError``. Branch on the string instead, for example
``if resp.error == "access_denied": ...`` (and ``login_required`` /
``interaction_required`` for a silent ``prompt=none`` attempt). For a ``response_mode=form_post`` callback pass the
:class:`~pygrindvakt.http.HttpRequestData` of the ``POST`` instead (with its
form already parsed). A werkzeug ``request.args`` can also be passed directly;
a plain ``dict`` is refused. When building an
:class:`~pygrindvakt.http.HttpRequestData` for the parser, pass ``query`` /
``form`` as a list of pairs (``request.args.items(multi=True)``), not a
``dict`` such as ``request.args.to_dict()``: a mapping-built channel raises
``TypeError`` because it has already dropped duplicate parameters.

:class:`~pygrindvakt.ConfigError` is handled before the generic branch, so a
broken deployment never looks like a failed login. In the generic branch the
status comes from the exception attributes: ``retryable`` (OP or network
trouble, the same callback may be retried later) gives 503, ``auth_failure``
gives 401, anything else gives 400. The status is for monitors and clients
only; the page body is generic and error details never reach the browser.

:func:`~pygrindvakt.rp.verify_id_token` checks the signature against the
JWKS, the explicit signing-algorithm allowlist, ``iss``, ``sub``, every
``aud`` value, ``azp`` when applicable, ``exp``, ``iat`` and the nonce, and
returns the claims as a dict. A non-200 from the token endpoint raises
:class:`pygrindvakt.AuthnError` (generic message; the upstream OAuth error is
in ``exc.code`` and the sanitized details in ``exc.upstream_*``). Treat
``upstream_error_description`` and ``upstream_body`` as secret-bearing: never
log them verbatim or show them to the user.

.. important:: The nonce is required.

   ``verify_id_token`` refuses ``expected_nonce=None`` with
   :class:`pygrindvakt.AuthnError`. Omitting the nonce in the code flow lets a
   captured id_token be replayed into a different session. The only way past
   the guard is
   ``unsafe_skip_nonce_check=True``, which emits a ``UserWarning`` and exists
   for flows that genuinely carry no nonce (a pure OAuth 2.0 flow whose
   token response happens to include an id_token). A nonce that *is* given
   is always enforced, flag or not.

OPs that sign ID tokens with HS256 (the client secret)
-------------------------------------------------------

An OP that registered ``id_token_signed_response_alg`` as ``HS256``,
``HS384`` or ``HS512`` MACs the ID token with a key derived from your
``client_secret`` (OIDC Core 10.1). It does not, and must not, publish that key
in its ``jwks_uri``. So these tokens are verified with a key set **you** build,
not with a fetched one:

.. code-block:: python

   import base64
   from pygrindvakt import rp

   secret = client_secret.encode()          # at least 32 bytes for HS256
   jwks = {"keys": [{"kty": "oct", "k": base64.urlsafe_b64encode(secret).rstrip(b"=").decode()}]}
   claims = rp.verify_id_token(jwks, ts.id_token, info.issuer, me.client_id, nonce, ["HS256"])

There is no flag and no warning for this: it is the specified way. Everything
else is refused. A :class:`~pygrindvakt.rp.JwksCache` with an ``HS*`` algorithm
raises :class:`~pygrindvakt.ConfigError` (``code == "shared_secret_algorithm"``),
and an ``oct`` key in a published JWK Set is dropped with a ``UserWarning`` by
:func:`~pygrindvakt.rp.fetch_jwks` and ``JwksCache``. A secret shorter than the
hash output (32, 48 or 64 bytes; RFC 7518 3.2) raises ``ConfigError`` with
``code == "weak_shared_secret"``: ask the OP for a longer client secret. See
ADR 0006.

.. versionchanged:: 0.3.0
   ``JwksCache`` with ``HS*`` raises, fetched ``oct`` keys are ignored and
   short secrets are refused.

Key caching and rotation
------------------------

Do not call :func:`~pygrindvakt.rp.fetch_jwks` per login: it costs a request
each time and gives no rotation handling. A
:class:`~pygrindvakt.rp.JwksCache` fetches the set on first use, reuses it for
the lifetime the OP advertises (``Cache-Control: max-age``, bounded by
``min_ttl`` / ``max_ttl``, else ``default_ttl``; ``no-store`` / ``no-cache`` are
floored to ``min_ttl``, and ``min_ttl=0`` leaves them uncached), and shares one fetch between
concurrent requests. When an id_token names a ``kid`` it does not have, it
refetches once (at most every ``min_refresh_interval`` seconds, so garbage
``kid`` values cannot flood the OP) and either verifies with the rotated key
or raises :class:`~pygrindvakt.UnknownKeyError`. It never serves an expired
set: if the OP is unreachable when the set expires, verification fails with an
:class:`~pygrindvakt.InternalError` (``code == "transport"``) instead of
trusting possibly revoked keys.

Concurrent callers share one fetch, and the others wait for it. That wait is
bounded by ``fetch_timeout`` (default 45 seconds: the built-in client's 30 second timeout plus margin): a waiter raises
:class:`~pygrindvakt.InternalError` with ``code == "jwks_fetch_timeout"``
instead of blocking forever. The bound covers only the waiting threads. The
thread that runs the fetch is not interrupted, so a Python ``HttpClient``
adapter must set its own network timeouts; a stalled adapter still stalls its
own caller. When it finally returns, its result is cached and later calls
work normally.

``Cache-Control`` is honoured only when the HTTP client reports response
headers. The built-in client (``http=None`` or a
:class:`~pygrindvakt.http.ReqwestClient`) always does; a Python adapter must
return them (a ``(status, body, content_type, headers)`` tuple or
:class:`~pygrindvakt.http.HttpFetchResponse` with ``headers``). Without them
``default_ttl`` applies and a ``UserWarning`` is emitted on the first fetch.

.. code-block:: python

   from pygrindvakt import UnknownKeyError

   try:
       claims = jwks_cache.verify_id_token(ts.id_token, me.client_id, nonce, ["ES256"])
   except UnknownKeyError:
       ...  # token signed by a key the issuer does not publish: reject

``rp.verify_id_token(jwks_cache, id_token, issuer, ...)`` is equivalent, but
``issuer`` must equal the cache's own issuer: a mismatch raises
:class:`pygrindvakt.ConfigError` before any fetch, so one provider's keys
can never vouch for another provider's ``iss``. The cache is accepted as ``jwks=`` by :func:`~pygrindvakt.rp.fetch_userinfo`
for signed UserInfo responses. Extra checks are keyword options on both:
``max_age`` (against ``auth_time``), ``acr_values``, ``access_token`` /
``require_at_hash``, ``authorization_code`` / ``require_c_hash``, ``leeway``
(see :func:`~pygrindvakt.rp.verify_id_token`).

.. warning::

   Implicit and hybrid flows (``code id_token``, ``code id_token token``) must
   pass ``access_token`` + ``require_at_hash=True`` and / or
   ``authorization_code`` + ``require_c_hash=True`` (or set
   ``strict_hashes=True``): ``verify_id_token`` does not notice a missing
   ``at_hash`` / ``c_hash`` binding otherwise, and by default ignores a hash
   claim when no value is given to check it against. ``strict_hashes=True``
   rejects hash claims it cannot check and requires ``at_hash`` / ``c_hash``
   whenever you pass ``access_token`` / ``authorization_code``. Code-flow
   callers who pass ``access_token`` but whose OP omits ``at_hash`` must leave
   it off.

.. code-block:: python

   claims = jwks_cache.verify_id_token(
       ts.id_token, me.client_id, nonce, ["ES256"],
       max_age=300, acr_values=["urn:mfa"],
       access_token=ts.access_token, require_at_hash=True,
   )

Userinfo
--------

.. code-block:: python

   if info.userinfo_endpoint is not None:  # OPs may omit UserInfo
       profile = rp.fetch_userinfo(
           http_client, info.userinfo_endpoint, ts.access_token, claims["sub"], info.issuer
       )

By default the request is a POST with the token in the ``Authorization``
header, which OIDC Core permits and every OP built with pygrindvakt accepts. A
non-200 raises :class:`pygrindvakt.AuthnError`. The response must contain a
string ``sub`` exactly equal to the validated ID-token subject. The result is a
dict; :func:`~pygrindvakt.rp.claims_to_attributes` flattens it (or the id_token
claims) into the ``{name: [values]}`` shape an attribute-based backend or a
SAML proxy expects.

Some OPs only accept GET, or answer with a signed ``application/jwt`` response.
Pass ``method="GET"`` (the HTTP client must support request headers on GET; the
built-in one does and never follows redirects), and for a signed response also
say how to verify it:

.. code-block:: python

   if info.userinfo_endpoint is not None:
       profile = rp.fetch_userinfo(
           http_client, info.userinfo_endpoint, ts.access_token, claims["sub"],
           info.issuer,
           method="GET",
           # the process-wide cache from the id_token section above; the
           # OP's UserInfo JOSE ``typ`` (use trust="dedicated_keys" instead
           # if the OP signs UserInfo with keys that never sign id_tokens)
           jwks=jwks_cache, client_id=me.client_id, allowed_algorithms=["ES256"],
           trust="typed", typ="userinfo+jwt",
       )

A signed response is never accepted without ``jwks``, ``client_id``,
``allowed_algorithms`` and ``trust`` (``AuthnError``, ``code ==
"userinfo_unverifiable"``). ``trust`` matters because OPs often sign UserInfo
with the same key as id_tokens, so a replayed id_token could pass as UserInfo:
``"typed"`` (the OP sets a UserInfo-specific JOSE ``typ``; pass it as ``typ``)
and ``"dedicated_keys"`` (``jwks`` holds only UserInfo signing keys) are safe;
``"untyped_shared_key_compat"`` is the weakest and accepts a fresh id_token
that lacks ``nonce``, ``at_hash`` and ``c_hash``. The token must also be no
more than ``max_age`` (300) seconds old by ``iat``; ``max_age=None`` disables
that and makes replay unbounded. Encrypted (JWE) UserInfo is not supported. See
:func:`~pygrindvakt.rp.fetch_userinfo` for the full rules.

The rest of the token response (``refresh_token``, ``expires_in``,
``scope``) is available as ``ts.raw``.

Authenticating with ``private_key_jwt``
---------------------------------------

With ``private_key_jwt`` the RP proves possession of a private key instead
of sending a shared secret; the OP holds only the public JWKS. Register the
public key set at the OP and give the :class:`~pygrindvakt.rp.RpClient` the
signing key:

.. code-block:: python

   from pygrindvakt import keys

   rp_key = keys.signing_key_from_pem(open("rp-key.pem", "rb").read(), kid="rp-1")
   # The OP registers: client.Client("jwt-rp", redirect_uris=[...],
   #                    token_endpoint_auth_method="private_key_jwt", jwks=rp_key.to_public_jwks())
   me = rp.RpClient("jwt-rp", "https://rp.example.com/cb", auth_method="private_key_jwt", signing_key=rp_key)

:func:`~pygrindvakt.rp.exchange_code` then builds and sends the assertion
itself. For other endpoints that require client authentication (introspection,
revocation, a federation OP's token endpoint from custom code), build one
explicitly with :func:`~pygrindvakt.rp.build_client_assertion`. The audience
is the token endpoint URL:

.. code-block:: python

   assertion = rp.build_client_assertion(rp_key, "jwt-rp", info.token_endpoint)
   form = [
       ("grant_type", "authorization_code"), ("code", code), ("redirect_uri", me.redirect_uri),
       ("client_assertion_type", "urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer"),
       ("client_assertion", assertion),
   ]
   status, body, _ = http_client.post_form(info.token_endpoint, form, [])

The assertion has ``iss`` = ``sub`` = ``client_id``, ``aud`` = the audience,
a 300-second lifetime and a random ``jti``; the OP consumes the ``jti`` so an
assertion cannot be replayed.

Signed request objects (JAR)
----------------------------

OpenID Federation automatic registration, and some OPs by policy, require the
authorization parameters to arrive as a signed JWT (RFC 9101).
:func:`~pygrindvakt.rp.signed_request_object` builds one from the same
inputs as ``authorization_url``; pass it as the ``request`` parameter
alongside the plain parameters:

.. code-block:: python

   jar = rp.signed_request_object(info, me, rp_key, state, nonce, code_challenge=challenge)
   url = rp.authorization_url(info, me, state, nonce, code_challenge=challenge, extra={"request": jar})

   # or, with generated state/nonce/verifier:
   url, state, nonce, verifier = rp.begin(info, me, request_object_key=rp_key)

Using a custom HTTP client
--------------------------

Every networked function takes ``http`` first: ``None`` for the shared
built-in client, an explicit :class:`~pygrindvakt.http.ReqwestClient` with
your own limits, or any object implementing
:class:`~pygrindvakt.http.HttpClientProtocol`. Reasons to inject your own:
a private CA, an outbound proxy, per-host allowlists, or tests.

.. code-block:: python

   import httpx

   class HttpxClient:
       def __init__(self, **kw):
           self._c = httpx.Client(follow_redirects=False, timeout=httpx.Timeout(10.0), **kw)

       def get(self, url):
           r = self._c.get(url)
           return r.status_code, r.content, r.headers.get("content-type")

       def post_form(self, url, form, headers):
           r = self._c.post(url, data=dict(form), headers=dict(headers))
           return r.status_code, r.content, r.headers.get("content-type")

   http_client = HttpxClient(verify="/etc/ssl/private-ca.pem", proxy="http://proxy.internal:3128")
   md = rp.discover(http_client, "https://op.internal.example")

The contract: return ``(status, body: bytes, content_type)``, optionally with a
4th ``headers`` element, or an
:class:`~pygrindvakt.http.HttpFetchResponse`; **never follow redirects**;
enforce timeouts; bound the body size. An exception is logged through
``sys.unraisablehook`` and surfaces as :class:`pygrindvakt.InternalError`.
The methods run on the thread that called ``rp.discover`` (holding the GIL);
they may call back into pygrindvakt, at the cost of a helper thread per
nested call.

Deployment: threads and fork
----------------------------

One :class:`~pygrindvakt.http.ReqwestClient` (or the ``http=None`` default)
can be shared by every thread of a worker; the GIL is released during I/O, so
requests run in parallel. After ``fork`` (gunicorn ``--preload``,
``multiprocessing``) the child rebuilds the connection pool and the tokio
runtime lazily, so a client created in the master before the fork is fine.
Fork only while no other thread is inside a pygrindvakt call: a lock held by
another thread at fork time stays locked in the child and can deadlock it.
Forking while another master thread has a request in flight is not
supported. A custom Python client runs on the calling thread with the GIL held
and must be thread-safe if shared. Create a ``RedisStore`` *after* fork. See
:ref:`ReqwestClient <reqwest-client-fork>` and :doc:`stores`.

Testing without a network
-------------------------

Because the HTTP client is injectable, an RP can be tested end to end against
an in-process :class:`~pygrindvakt.provider.Provider`, as
``tests/test_rp.py`` does: a fake client answers discovery and JWKS from
``op.discovery_document()`` / ``op.jwks_document()`` and forwards token and
userinfo requests to ``op.handle_token_request`` / ``op.userinfo``. Those
nested calls into pygrindvakt from inside the fake are supported; each runs
on a helper thread (see :doc:`stores`).

Logout
------

If the OP advertises an ``end_session_endpoint`` (OIDC RP-Initiated Logout
1.0), it is available as ``info.end_session_endpoint`` after discovery. Clear
your own session first, then redirect the browser to
:func:`~pygrindvakt.rp.end_session_url`:

.. code-block:: python

   if info.end_session_endpoint is not None:
       logout_url = rp.end_session_url(
           info,
           id_token_hint=session["id_token"],
           client=me,  # RpClient(..., post_logout_redirect_uris=["https://rp.example.com/logged-out"])
           post_logout_redirect_uri="https://rp.example.com/logged-out",
           state=util.random_token(24),
       )
       # redirect the browser to logout_url

``post_logout_redirect_uri`` must be registered with the OP and also on the
client, via ``RpClient(..., post_logout_redirect_uris=[...])``.
``end_session_url`` accepts it only when ``client`` is passed and the value
exactly equals a registered entry; anything else (including a value from
``request.args``, or an ``id_token_hint``-only call) raises
``BadRequestError``. This prevents logout from becoming an open redirect to a
host the attacker chose. A provider without an ``end_session_endpoint`` makes ``end_session_url`` raise
``ConfigError``; end only the local session in that case.

``id_token_hint`` carries the full ID token and goes to the first hop, the
host of the ``end_session_endpoint``. Therefore ``ProviderInfo`` requires that
endpoint to have the same origin as the issuer (scheme, host, effective port),
besides the https / no-credentials / no-fragment checks. ``ProviderInfo(...)``
raises ``ConfigError`` for a cross-origin endpoint, and
``ProviderInfo.from_metadata`` drops it, so ``info.end_session_endpoint`` is
``None`` and ``end_session_url`` raises ``ConfigError`` (the advertised endpoint
was missing, unsafe, or on a different origin than the issuer). If the OP
legitimately logs out on another origin, opt in explicitly with
``allow_cross_origin_end_session=True`` on ``ProviderInfo(...)`` or
``ProviderInfo.from_metadata(...)``.

``ProviderMetadata`` itself only checks scheme, credentials, fragment and
control characters; it does not compare hosts with the issuer. An RP that gets
metadata from anything other than its own TLS discovery of the issuer (a
config service, a database row) must pin the host itself. The other metadata
endpoints (revocation, introspection, PAR, ``check_session_iframe``) are not
origin-checked.

Security notes
--------------

* Parse the callback with :func:`~pygrindvakt.rp.parse_authorization_response`,
  check ``state`` (constant time) before touching anything else, and pop the
  session entry so it cannot be reused. Compare ``iss`` with ``matches_iss``.
* Always pass the stored nonce; never ``unsafe_skip_nonce_check`` in a code
  flow.
* Prefer ``private_key_jwt``; load the key from a file or HSM, not source.
* Treat every :class:`pygrindvakt.AuthnError` as log material.
* Keep the built-in HTTP client unless you need a private CA or proxy, and
  then keep its three properties.

See :doc:`security` for the full list.
